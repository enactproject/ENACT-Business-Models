      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        
Companies in highly regulated markets lack mechanisms for continuously monitoring risk evolution. In particular:
- Systems and processes complexity grows, human control is the new risk
- There are no tools to effectively monitor mitigation efficiency
- Risk is multi-stakeholder and assets need to be understood in context</p>

      <b>Existing Alternatives</b> </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        
Companies are currently using not suitable mechanisms such as excel (which does not allow for real-time control, specially when complesity scales up) or commercial tools for risk management (which tend to focus on risk management at design time).</p>
