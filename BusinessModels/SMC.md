      <p>
        The lack of holistic security assurance for IoT systems, companies cannot guarantee high security and privacy levels. It is difficult to monitor IoT environments, and lack of automatic remediation in case of SLA violation. Compliance with GDPR requires systematisation of security and privacy assurance mechanisms and evidences be collected.
