        The development and operation of smart IoT systems need support for continuous deployment over ALL different layers of IoT, Edge, and Cloud infrastructures. This includes deployment over local resources (including in local area network) with no direct access to the Internet. Moreover, the complexity of such smart IoT systems and the uncertainty of operating environments (e.g., evolving security threats) urge for trustworthy deployment (i.e., support for deploying trustworthiness mechanisms such as security/privacy controls, and mechanisms reliable deployment such as to properly monitor what has been deployed)

Current solutions: (i) No deployment solution tailored for IoT, Edge, and Cloud infrastructures (in particular no support for deployment on devices with no direct access to Internet), (ii) No monitoring of the execution flow of the application. Monitoring is particularly relevant for debugging on IoT devices (as this is typically a complicated task), (iii) deployment tools do not integrate with security and privacy tools, and (iv) no customizable solution for rolling and continuous deployment.
