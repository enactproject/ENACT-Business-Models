      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        App Developer: testing application on a real IoT devices network is costly (for infrastructure), not scalable (impossible to deploy 1000 sensors just for testing), time and effort consuming (for software developer who has no hardware expertise)
      </p>
      <p>
        App Operator: needs to make sure all the functionalities, operations of the application work properly in different scenarios. But there are many scenarios that do not happen frequently in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        App Owner: needs to make sure the system is scalable, secured but cannot perform those tests on the production environment

        Developer performs unit tests of their application and also test the application on the production environment. There is no way to test for scalability and different cyber security attack scenarios.
