    <td rowspan="1">
      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>Tellu delivers IoT platform and services within the digital health domain. The customer needs are digitalisation and automation within the health and welfare services to be more efficient and to deliver better services. Examples are Remote Patient Monitoring, allowing patients to stay longer at home, reduce travels to/from hospitals etc. for both care providers and care consumers. Another example is digitalty and supervision (e.g., to supervise elderly living at home (e.g., applying sensors, video-based etc). An important component in these kind of digitalisation scenarios is the Personal Health Gateway ensuring trustworthy flexible and controlled management of the IoT-based system.</p>

      <b>Existing Alternatives</b> </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>The current situation is a set of isolated services coming with the complete stack of hardware and software across the IoT, edge and cloud space. This alternative is not sustainable, as the scaling of these services need to be build on flexible platforms and infrastructures that enable interoperation and integration of a set of eHealth services as well as provisioning of data to various stakeholders, electronic patient journals, etc. </p>

      <b>Exploitation Form</b> </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>To achieve the new generation of trustworthy services for the digital health domain, there are several ENACT tools and enablers that we plan to exploit in industrial use. In particular, the continous deployment and delivery of the Personal Health Gateway, is planned to be exploited to improve the delivery process. The Security and Privacy monitoring and control enabler will be exploited both in terms of knowledge transfer to upgrade the security architecture of our digital health solutions and in terms of technologies to better handle authentication and authorisation across the IoT, edge and cloud space. The risk driven decission support enabler will be exploited in terms of knowledge transfer to improve our risk analysis processes related to our products. Finally it is planned to exploit results form the Robustness and Resilience enabler to improve robustness and resilience of our products, mainly through knowledge transfer. </p>
