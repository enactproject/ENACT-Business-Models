  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <b> Revenue Sources</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>Main sources of revenue:
<ul>
<li> Licences: Perpetual Licenses on a One-Time Fee basis.
  The price is  based on the number of users and then  OPTIONS can be ordered.

  Minimal order is 100 users, with degressive pricing points at 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 25000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 500000 and 1000000 users. 
  Pricing for larger deployments and site licences are directly negotiated on a case by case basis.
  Special Pricing is proposed for external users, CUSTOMERS mitigating the price with a 0,25 ratio.
  Special Pricing is proposed for external users, BUSINESS PARTNERS mitigating the price with a 0,50 ratio.</li></ul>

In addition, two criteria can significally change the price:
<ul>
  <li>A global purchase order for the total number of users, rather than an incremental purchase;</li>
  <li>The fact that more than one product is ordered.</li></ul>

OBVIOUSLY taking into account the competition we are facing can also significantly change the pricing offered as well as knowledge of customer budget
<ul>
<li> Support & Maintenance: To benefit from updates, in the case of Perpetual Licenses, a customer must subscribe to a Standard Support & Maintenance contract which also gives access to a number of other Support & Maintenance services. List Price of the Standard Support & Maintenance contract is calculated at a yearly rate of 20% of the License Fee list price. </li>

<li> POC: Proof of Concept in customer environment</li>

<li> Professional Services: Evidian delivers a specific catalog of professional services for all these operations.</li></ul>
